My name is Aliya. I code and ML techniques to decipher biological questions and to advance medicine. Currently, I am a Master's of Bioinformatics student at Loyola University Chicago. I am developing a thesis that uses ML models to generate genetic expression predictions of single-cell liver models to discover novel biomarkers for potential therapies targeting liver disease. 

### Skills
- Python
- R
- Command Line
- SLURM
- High-Performance Cloud Computing (HPC)
- Java
- SQL
- Linux

### Thesis Project

- PlasmaXcan : predicts genetic expression from single-cell hepatoctye data to decipher the underlying genetic drivers of plasma regulation and liver health
  https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/PlasmaXcan

### Passion Project 
- ASLingo prototype : training Google's MediaPipe Hand Landmarker algorithm on mp4 files depicting the ASL alphabet and basic words to create a ML-based 
ASL learning and translation tool
https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/ASLingo

### Past Projects
- PubMedSearch : scrapes relevant articles from PubMed, then pushes them to AirTable, sends a Slack message notification to #pubmedsearch channel (integrates PubMed, AirTable, and Slackbot APIs)
  https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/PubMedSearch
- Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis : identifies stastistically significant protein protein interactions between different conditions
   https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/SpectronautToMiST
- RNA-Sequencing Analysis-Informed Proteomics: combines STAR aligner with Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS) and Junction Centric Alternative Splicing Translator (JCAST) to identify novel alternate splicing events in patients with poor responses to LVAD heart treatment to elucidate the varying effectiveness of LVAD treatment on different patient demographics

### Skills in Development
- Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS, React)
- Docker
- MERN Stack
