My name is Aliya. I code to decipher biological questions and to advance medicine. Currently, I am a Master's of Bioinformatics student at Loyola University Chicago. I am developing a thesis that explores the usage of predictive single-cell liver models and machine learning to discover novel biomarkers and potential therapies for liver disease. 

### Skills
- Python
- R
- Command Line
- R
- SLURM scripts/Cloud Computing
- SQL

### Thesis Project (in progress) ![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-25%25-brightgreen)
- PlasmaXcan : predicts genetic expression from single-cell hepatoctye data to decipher the underlying genetic drivers of plasma regulation and liver health
  https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/PlasmaXcan

### Side Project (in progress) ![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-10%25-brightgreen)
-ASLingo prototype : Training Google's MediaPipe Hand Landmarker algorithm on mp4 files depicting the ASL alphabet and basic words to create a ML-based 
ASL learning and translation tool

### Past Projects
- Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis : identifies stastistically significant protein protein interactions between different conditions
   https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/SpectronautToMiST
- PubMedSearch : scrapes relevant articles from PubMed, then pushes them to AirTable, sends a Slack message notification to #pubmedsearch channel (integrates PubMed, AirTable, and Slackbot APIs)
  https://github.com/aliyaliyuan/PubMedSearch
- RNA-Sequencing Analysis-Informed Proteomics: combines STAR aligner with Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS) and Junction Centric Alternative Splicing Translator (JCAST) to identify novel alternate splicing events in patients with poor responses to LVAD heart treatment to elucidate the varying effectiveness of LVAD treatment on different patient demographics
